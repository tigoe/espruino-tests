 Anonymous Multi Blinker For Espruino

 This script demonstrates how to run multiple intervals with different timing.
 And execute anonymous function whick swap LED value

 It is based on Tom Igoe's multiBlink.js example
 at https://github.com/tigoe/espruino-tests/blob/master/multiBlink.js

 However, it uses less memory but more processor cycle

// Call the anonymous function (which reads and swaps LED1 value)
// repeatedly every 100 milliseconds

// repeatedly every 200 milliseconds
